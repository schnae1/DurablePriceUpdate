# Durable Price Update

Durable Price Update pulls current distrubutor pricing from the manufacturer's website. 

The program accepts as input a list of part numbers from an excel file. These part numbers are entered eight at a time, submitted on the site, then retreived by reading the output result from the website and put into an excel file.

The program utilizes jExcel Api along with the HtmlUnit Api. Documentation for both Api's can be found below.
